I use this repo to learn a bit about the C programming language. I also wanted to learn a bit about web servers and the HTTP/1.1 protocol as described in [RFC 7230](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230).

## Features
- Listen for requests on port 8080
- Send a response


That's it :)

## Goals
- [x] Listen for requests and write a response
- [ ] Actually parse the HTTP headers
- [ ] Respond in different ways depending on the route or HTTP method (GET/POST)
